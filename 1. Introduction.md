# SkyPet
Hello open source/blockchain/startup community!  We are SkyPet, the decentralized platform for pet data.  

I used to live in Winston Salem, NC.  The "Triad" area has three main cities: Winston Salem, High Point, and Greensboro.  I typically left my dog, Penny, in the local dog day care.  One day I had to work out of Greensboro which was far enough away to require me to put Penny in the Greensboro day care.  I was dissapointed to find that they wouldn't just take Penny but required prior appointments to assess Penny's temperament and her ability to socialize with other dogs.  Here was a dog day care that was a mere half hour away and yet the two centers did not communicate with each other; yielding inefficiencies for them and for me.  

That day I had a vision for how pet service should be.  Data generated by the Penny should remain with Penny.  The data should be immutable and not tied to the financial health of any one company.  The data should be secure and only available to people who I want it to be available to.  In short, I want to own Penny's data.  We founded SkyPet in order to acheive this vision.

SkyPet is built on the Ethereum blockchain.  We use the ID from the chip which many pets have to encrypt all data sent to the smart contract.  The hash of the ID identifies the pet on the blockchain.  Optional additional encryption is possible for sensitive medical or owner records.  The contract allows pet owners access to records such as vaccinations, prescriptions, and data created via pet devices. We also will provide an easy to use API to allow our platform to be a hub for pet Internet of Things (IoT) applications. 

While other technology companies focus on the communication of thoughts and ideas, SkyPet leverages technology to simplify pet ownership for the busy, working professional. Whether using the platform as a repository for medical data or for checking in on your petâ€™s wellness while you are away, SkyPet keeps owners, pets, and vets connected and alert.

Paperwork and phone calls are still the typical method for Pet Services firms to validate pet information for everything from a new apartment rental to a bath at a pet salon.  The process of verification from all parties can consume up to an hour of time, split between pet owners, human verification, and business to business phone calls. Many businesses have to turn away pet owners missing a critical piece of information, losing revenue. SkyPet solves the problems arising from missing and disperse pet data, keeping pet owners happy and saving businesses money.

##Roadmap

1. Create a smart contract on Ethereum.  This smart contract development is at [SmartContracts](https://github.com/SkyPet/SmartContracts)
2. Create a desktop app for Windows, Linux, and OSX using Ethereum light client.  The project development is at [SkyPetDesktop](https://github.com/SkyPet/SkyPetDesktop).
3. Create a public API using an internal instance of Ethereum.  This will not be "decentralized" in the standard sense as it relies on us for storing accounts and hosting the API.  In this sense it is similar to an exchange.  The project is partially underway and is at [SkyPetContractWrapper](https://github.com/SkyPet/SkyPetContractWrapper).
4. Create a web app which consumes the API.  
5. Create Android/IOS apps.  

At some point we hope to partner with a hardware chip scanning company to integrate our technology with the scanners.
