Hello open source/blockchain/startup community!  We are SkyPet, the decentralized platform for pet data.  

Building on Blockchain technology, SkyPet provides pet owners access to pet records such as vaccinations, prescriptions, and data created via pet devices. SkyPet IoT applications will allow new insight into the lives and health of our furry companions. 

Pet technology has been begging for adoption. While other technology companies focus on the communication of thoughts and ideas, SkyPet leverages technology to simplify pet ownership for the busy, working professional. Whether using the platform as a repository for medical data or for checking in on your petâ€™s wellness while you are away, SkyPet keeps owners, pets, and vets connected and alert.

Paperwork and phone calls are still the typical method for Pet Services firms to validate pet information for everything from a new apartment rental to a bath at a pet salon.  The process of verification from all parties can consume up to an hour of time, split between pet owners, human verification, and business-business phone calls. Many businesses have to turn away pet owners missing a critical piece of information, losing revenue. SkyPet solves the problems arising from missing and disperse pet data, keeping pet owners happy and saving businesses money.

## ABOUT SKYPET
SkyPet was founded by Daniel Stahl, Thomas Nguyen, Aaron Bridgers, and Chris Kennedy. We are bankers turned software developers with an interest in Fintech.  We want to make blockchain applications accessible to everyone.  We want to lower barriers to entry by streamlining the installation and use of Ethereum software. 

Our plan is as follows:

1. Create a smart contract on Ethereum.  This smart contract development is at [SmartContracts](https://github.com/SkyPet/SmartContracts)
2. Create a desktop app for Windows, Linux, and OSX using Ethereum light client.  This project is underway and is at [SkyPetDesktop](https://github.com/SkyPet/SkyPetDesktop).
3. Create a public API using an internal instance of Ethereum.  This will not be "decentralized" in the standard sense.  The project is partially underway and is at [SkyPetContractWrapper](https://github.com/SkyPet/SkyPetContractWrapper).
4. Create an web app which consumes the API.  
5. Create Android/IOS apps.
